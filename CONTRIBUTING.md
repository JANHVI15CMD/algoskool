### 3. **Make Your Changes**

Make sure to write clean, modular, and well-documented code. Adhere to the following standards:
  
- **Follow best coding practices** (Use Prettier, ESLint for linting JS, etc.).
- **Document your code**: Use comments to explain complex logic.
- **Write Tests**: If you're adding a feature, try to include tests for it (preferably unit and integration tests).

### 4. **Commit Your Changes**

We use the following convention for commit messages:

- `fix:` for bug fixes.
- `feat:` for new features.
- `docs:` for documentation changes.
- `test:` for adding tests.
  
- Example:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat: add AI-guided coding hints feature"
  ```

  ```bash
  git push origin feature/new-awesome-feature
  ```

- Make sure your PR includes:
  - A clear title and description of the changes.
  - Screenshots or gifs if relevant.
  - Any potential issues or side effects the change might cause.

We will review your PR as soon as possible. If changes are requested, please address them promptly.


## üß™ **Running Tests**

To ensure that your changes do not introduce any bugs, it‚Äôs important to run tests before submitting a pull request. AlgoSkool uses **Jest** and **Mocha** for unit and integration testing. You can run the tests using the following commands:

```bash
npm test
```

Make sure that all tests pass, and try to add tests for any new functionality or features.

## üìù **Code Style Guidelines**

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
- **HTML/CSS**: Write clean, semantic HTML and use BEM methodology for CSS class naming.
- **React Components**: Use functional components and hooks where possible.
- **Python for ML Models**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines.

Lint your code with:
```bash
npm run lint
```
